<h1 align="center">RandomLootChest - StarterExtension</h1>

<p align="center">Hey, this is <b>StarterExtension</b> which allows you to add starter items which are given when: <b>someone joins for the first time or someone dies</b>.</p>

<h2 align="center">Is it useful or something like that?</h2>
<p align="center">It is for those, who are trying to create something like <b>ChestPvP</b>, etc.</p>

<h2 align="center">Is it hard to configure?</h2> 
<p align="center">No! It's really simple! You have <b>config.yml</b> where you set all values!</p>

<h2 align="center">How to setup?</h2>
<p align="center">There's not too much to say, you have to:
<ul><li>Put this extension to <b>RandomLootChest/extensions</b> directory</li>
  <li>Start the server</li>
  <li>If you want to configure, just stop the server and setup all values in <b>RandomLootChest/StarterExtension/config.yml</b></li>
  <li>After configuration, just start server and have fun!</li></p>
